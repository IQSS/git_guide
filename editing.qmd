# Editing {.sec-editing}

## When you are the only one editing at the time:

When finished with an editing session:

<ol type="1">
  <li>Pull: in the terminal window, type “git pull”</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This merges in any changes someone else made to the repo</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Commit: in the terminal window, type “git commit -am <your commit message>” </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This prepares your changes for uploading</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Push: in the terminal window, type “git push”</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This uploads your changes to the GitHub repository</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

Next time you are ready to edit:
Pull, then edit as you like, then Commit and Push.

## When someone else is also editing (a different part of the file):

<ol type="1">
  <li>Commit: in the terminal window, type “git commit -am <your commit message>”
</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This protects your changes</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Pull: in the terminal window, type “git pull” </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This merges in what your friend did</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Push: in the terminal window, type “git push”</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This uploads your changes to the GitHub repository</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

If you try pulling without committing, you will get an error.

## When someone else (unfortunately) edits the same line as you

You must resolve these differences!

<ol type="1">
  <li>Pull: in the terminal window, type “git pull”</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>You will get a "merge conflict" error message</li>
  </ol>
  <li> Edit your file. You will see something like this: <br>
  <<<<<<<<<<< <br>
  passage written by person 1 <br>
  =========== <br>
  passage written by person 2 <br>
  >>>>>>>>>>> <br>
  </li>
  <li> Remove one of the passages, as well as the <<<, ===, and >>> symbols.</li>
  <li>Commit: in the terminal window, type “git commit -am <your commit message>” </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This prepares your changes for uploading</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Push: in the terminal window, type “git push”</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>This uploads your changes to the GitHub repository</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
